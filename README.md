## 🧠 Why I Built This App

I built TuneLyf to gain hands-on experience in developing a complete Android media application using modern tools and architecture.  
This project helped me understand real-world challenges such as background playback, service lifecycle management, notification synchronization, and scalable app architecture.

Publishing the app on the Play Store gave me practical exposure to production deployment and app maintenance.
